# Since THERMOS is no longer being developed- and servers are reduced to using Sponge for 1.8+, this project is dedicated to renewing the ability for Minecraft servers to use native bukkit plugins along with Forge mods.

# This is for the 1.12.x version of Contigo.

# Contigo

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/djoveryde/Contigo.svg?branch=1.12.x)](https://travis-ci.org/djoveryde/Contigo)
![Minecraft Forge v14.22.0.2465][forge]
![Minecraft v1.12.1][mc]
![Java JDK v1.8][java]
![Spigot 1.12.1 Snapshot][spigot]

### What's Contigo?
Contigo is a fork of Thermos, a craftbukkit forge server for Minecraft 1.7.10. After Thermos was discontinued, Contigo was created to allow active members of the Minecraft coding community to optimize it and provide fixes in a timely manner.

We hope to eliminate all issues with craftbukkit forge servers. In the end, we envision a seamless, low lag Contigo experience with support for new 1.8+ versions of Minecraft.

### djoveryde version?
Since 1.12.X is now being used for a vast majority of current forge/ftb mods, as well as a need for it with regards to our own server. This is our attempt of updating Contigo/Thermos to a more recent version of Minecraft.

Advantages over KCauldron:
+ Lag-lowering optimizations
+ Better world protection (Forge stuff doesn't bypass Bukkit plugins!)
+ Many patches that KCauldron didn't get from Spigot
+ Dupe glitch fixes
